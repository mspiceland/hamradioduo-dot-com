            <p>Hey, it’s Michael (N4FFF) and Becky (N4BKY) and we're diving into the exciting world of HF (High Frequency) ham radio for beginners. We recently had the opportunity to talk with a new ham about how "lonely" it was having not gotten to have any new contacts locally with his new technician class license. We thought about how much fun we've been having meeting people from all over.  The difference? HF. We decided to share the basics that we would have wanted to know when we first got started.</p><h2 id="essential-gear-for-global-contacts">Essential Gear for Global Contacts</h2><p>In our latest video, we show you how to start with HF ham radio without overspending. All you really need is a radio, an antenna, and a battery. In particular, the highly portable low power radios really are magic.  We share some of the ones we have and go through some details.</p><p>Our antenna lineup ranges from a simple banana clip antenna using speaker wire to our more recent, easy-to-deploy End Fed Half Wave antennas. These are excellent, practical options we frequently use—perfect for getting started.</p><h2 id="powering-up-the-adventure">Powering Up the Adventure</h2><p>Powering your outdoor radio adventure isn't complicated either.  The USB-C PD power backs are game changers.  We use the INIU Power Bank paired with a 12V USB-C PD to Barrel Plug Trigger Cable, it's ideal for taking anywhere. We also provide alternatives suitable for radios requiring a bit more power than the smaller, low-power radios we typically use.</p><h2 id="cw-bonus">CW Bonus </h2><p>We couldn't leave out our favorite gear component—the Morse code key! Since we primarily operate in CW mode, we share our preferences: Becky’s straight keys and Mike’s paddles.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jgxlZk5HL4s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h2 id="watch-and-start-your-radio-journey">Watch and Start Your Radio Journey!</h2><p>Accessing the HF bands is really just a few pieces of gear away. Whether you're brand-new or looking for low-cost portable radio tips, this video offers an inviting and fun way to join us in playing radio.</p><p>73,</p><p>Michael N4FFF &amp; Becky N4BKY</p><h2 id="support-and-links">Support and Links</h2><p>Curious about the gear?
