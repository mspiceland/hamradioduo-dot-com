            <h2 id="introducing-qsofinder">Introducing QSOFinder</h2><p>We’re excited to talk about a cool new tool called QSOFinder. &nbsp;If you love Morse code and ham radio as much as we do, you know how thrilling it is to sit down at your rig, ready for a QSO, only to find yourself calling CQ into the void. Wouldn't it be great if there were an easier way to find other operators looking for the same kind of QSO you are? Well, we thought so too, so we built it!</p><h2 id="what-makes-qsofinder-special">What Makes QSOFinder Special?</h2><p>QSOFinder is a bit like having a super power at your fingertips. It's like spotting yourself for POTA, but not for POTA.  It helps you find other CW operators to chat with quickly and easily. Instead of searching and waiting, you can get some super powers. As someone looking, you get insight into the types of QSOs or speeds when you are looking. As someone posting, you get to be discovered more easily (like POTA activators do). With QSOFinder, you won't miss out on any exciting conversations whether you're new and just want to try a quick exchange, or a seasoned CW op and want a long conversational ragchew.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uChegWhuDhE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>If you’re ready to see QSOFinder in action, check out the video and join us on this fun new adventure. We're sure this is going to be a tool you'll absolutely love. </p><p>Our main goal with HamRadioDuo has always been to inspire and encourage others to get on the air, have fun, and build their skills. QSOFinder is just another way we’re trying to make that happen.</p><p>Give it a try at <a href="http://qsofinder.com"><strong><u>QSOFinder.com</u></strong></a>, and let us know what you think!&nbsp; The more people posting to make themselves available and the more operators answering those already on the site, the more fun this will be.</p><p>Happy QSOs!!!</p><p>73 Mike N4FFF es Becky N4BKY</p><p>P.S.
