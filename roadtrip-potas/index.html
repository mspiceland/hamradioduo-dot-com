            <p>We dropped our daughter off for another round of college fun in Florida. On the way home, we thought what a better way to break up the time, then to look for some parks to do POTA!</p><p>We ended up stopping at three places – – Florida cavern, State Park, a wildlife refuge taco the way in the middle of nowhere, and Rickwood cavern State park in Alabama.</p><p>We had a fantastic time! First off, POTA was just the excuse we needed to get out and stretch our legs. We never would've stopped at Florida cavern, State Park otherwise, and would've kept on driving. What a treat to get to go do a unique Florida hike, and at the same time.</p><h3 id="florida-caverns-state-park-us-1867">Florida Caverns State Park US-1867</h3><p>For the Florida activation, it was our first time using our POTA 20 mast leaned up against the tree. It paired perfectly with the K6AKEFHW antenna! With that particular antenna, there's no coax. We just unravel it in a way we go. It was so easy to extend the mast and then just lean it up against the tree. It was definitely a treat to get to you such a small pack they fit in our backpack for a quick results.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pw_5ToWZNrM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Road Trip QRP POTA Activation  |  Florida Caverns State Park  |  Ham Radio CW Practice"></iframe></figure><h3 id="pike-county-pocosin-complex-state-fish-and-wildlife-area-us-3701">Pike County Pocosin Complex State Fish and Wildlife Area US-3701</h3><p>The next place we stopped, was a wildlife refuge, kind of in the middle of nowhere. We got to a rule area before pulling over in a little tucked away spot. In that case, we did the activation from the truck, with Michael activating that time.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/images/2024/11/PXL_20240825_204832089--1-.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900" srcset="/images/size/w600/2024/11/PXL_20240825_204832089--1-.jpg 600w, /images/size/w1000/2024/11/PXL_20240825_204832089--1-.jpg 1000w, /images/2024/11/PXL_20240825_204832089--1-.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="rickwood-caverns-state-park-us-1050">Rickwood Caverns State Park US-1050</h3><p>The last place we stopped, was Rickwood Caverns State Park in Alabama. It was our fastest, Poda, activation ever! We literally had less than 30 minutes before the park closed at the same time as the UTC day ended. We ended up setting up doing an activation, and tearing it down all within 30 minutes! The actual activation was probably less than 15 minutes. What an adrenaline rush!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2I39PbHNxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Becky's Fastest CW POTA Activation Attempt Ever | Race against UTC end of day!"></iframe></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/images/2024/11/all_contacts_map-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900" srcset="/images/size/w600/2024/11/all_contacts_map-1.png 600w, /images/size/w1000/2024/11/all_contacts_map-1.png 1000w, /images/2024/11/all_contacts_map-1.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
