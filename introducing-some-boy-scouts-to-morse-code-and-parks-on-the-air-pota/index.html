            <h1 id="monte-sano-state-park-a-perfect-spot">Monte Sano State Park: A Perfect Spot</h1><p>Monte Sano State Park in Alabama is a beautiful place and a great location to find a new spot for our latest POTA activation. The park offers amazing views and lots of hiking trails that any adventurer would love. But this time, we weren't alone! Boy Scout Troops 322 and 41 joined us as we shared the wonders of Ham Radio and Morse Code.</p><h1 id="sharing-the-morse-code-magic">Sharing the Morse Code Magic</h1><p>Teaching anyone new about ham radio is always rewarding, and finding a way to get the next generation of operators excited was an amazing opportunity! With our QCX mini rig, K6ARK EFHW antenna, and POTA dog Rose, we set up to share Morse Code magic. The Boy Scouts were very curious and had tons of really great questions. It was heartwarming to see them interested in every step along the way including a few chaotic pile-ups as we explained how it all works.  Becky also had a fun challenge trying to send and talk at the same time!</p><p>We had contacts from all across the country!  This time, we connected with 13 different stations spanning eight states. The farthest contact reached was an incredible 1,064 miles away in Colorado! The Scouts were amazed and kept asking great questions like, "Does everyone have a unique call sign?" or "What keeps them from just going anytime?".  Seeing their excitement was priceless.</p><h1 id="keep-the-dits-and-dahs-going">Keep the Dits and Dahs Going!</h1><p>This activation wasn’t just about contacts; it was about inspiring the next generation of hams. Our young visitors left excited about the world of ham radio. Who knows, maybe one of them will be a future ham radio CW operator and we  are honored to get them in our logs one-day! We hope you'll check out the video and see this special day in action. Let's keep the Morse Code tradition alive, one dit at a time.<br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NsKKhH3kK2o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h1 id="support-and-gear">Support and Gear</h1><p>If you're interested, you can support us or explore some of the cool gear we use.
