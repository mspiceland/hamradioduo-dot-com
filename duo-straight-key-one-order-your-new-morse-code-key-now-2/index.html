            <p>Meet our latest creation: the Duo Straight Key ONE. <br><br>We love straight keys. We recently restored a WWII-era J-38 and absolutely fell in love with the way that it felt. The long lever arm action provides a very smooth punchy feel as the letters just pop out. We wished we could tell everyone to go to their local amateur radio store and pick one up, because it felt that amazing. We wondered how close we could get if we designed something ourselves using a similar long lever arm action. We also incorporated a modern magnetic tension. I don't think we expected it to turn at as well as it did, but it worked! We found ourselves gravitating to the new key even though it is right next to the J-38. <br><br>You can now pick one up for yourself!<br><a href="https://shop.hamradioduo.com/">https://shop.hamradioduo.com/</a> <br><br>We did make a full video, but here are some highlights about why we designed a key and some of the specifics.  Our goal was an accessible straight key to help everyone get on the air, but also something that felt great based on our own experiences.</p><h2 id="discover-the-duo-straight-key-one">Discover the Duo Straight Key ONE</h2><p>Why did we make a CW straight key? Because we love the hobby! We wanted a key that gives you the best experience without any hassle. Inspired by the famous J-38's long-arm design, we added a modern twist with magnetic tension. This makes your keying experience unbelievably smooth and and crisp at the same time.</p><h2 id="how-were-giving-back">How we're giving back?</h2><p>Every Straight Key One sold helps us build extra keys to donate to new operators and young hams, encouraging more people to get into this wonderful hobby!</p><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q-S2I1kFML4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Here is the full introduction to our new design and a little more about the "WHY" behind our creation.</p><h2 id="where-can-i-get-one">Where can I get one?</h2><ul><li><a href="https://shop.hamradioduo.com/">DUO Straight Key ONE</a> </li></ul><h2 id="stay-connected">Stay Connected!</h2><p>Don't forget to follow our channels to following along.
