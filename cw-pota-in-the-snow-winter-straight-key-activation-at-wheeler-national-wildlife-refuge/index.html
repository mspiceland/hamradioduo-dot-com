            <p>Brrr! We finally ventured out in the cold for a POTA. Situated in Alabama, this refuge is renowned for its stunning wetlands and diverse array of wildlife. It's a huge area and there are lots of places to activate. We visited an area with a local boat ramp with a trail that leads over by the water. We'd just been snowed in for several days (it doesn't take much here in Alabama) and it was the first day with the snow melting away.</p><p>lt also happens to be part of the historic Trail of Tears National Historic Trail cutting through parts of the refuge, carrying with it stories of the past.</p><h1 id="chilled-fingers-and-straight-keys-a-cw-adventure">Chilled Fingers and Straight Keys: A CW Adventure</h1><p>After waiting for Mother Nature to clear the roads and provide a safe passage, we gathered up our favorite quick pack for POTA – our QCX Mini and K6ARK EFHW antenna that doesn't require a coax.  Becky brought her new Putikeeg straight key and Michael forgot his paddles, and ended up activating with her straight key after she got done.</p><p>Armed with our trusty QCX mini, an EFHW antenna, we quickly deployed the antenna with a POT20 mast leaning in some tree branches! Spoiler alert: Our chilly activation was a resounding success, with 16 fabulous contacts in 27 minutes, reaching as far as British Columbia and Massachusetts.
