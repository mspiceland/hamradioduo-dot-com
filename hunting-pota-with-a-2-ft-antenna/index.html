            <p>We recently did a there-and-back trip to get our daughter from college in Florida.  We made an adventure out of it, by playing radio pretty much the whole trip!<br><br>It was a great excuse to stress test a new antenna we are working on, the "Just OK Antenna".  We're hoping to sort out some things and eventually see if there would be a market for it. Let me first try a sales pitch on you.</p><hr><p>Are you sick of breaking through pile-ups with ease? Is your radio sick of perfect antennas with a 1:1 match? You might want to try the Just OK Antenna. It's for folks looking for an antenna that just gets the job done.<br><br>Meet, the JUST OK ANTENNA.  At less than 2 feet, your friends won't believe you are even a ham radio person. Can that really be a 20 meter antenna? Yes. <br><br>Gone are the days of having to take our antenna off to get in the garage or even parking garages. You probably lose an S unit in signal reports, but at least you can play radio anywhere, anytime.  With – the Just OK Antenna.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/2025/04/PXL_20250427_191622589.PORTRAIT-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="563" height="594"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The prototype antenna on our truck bed mount.</span></figcaption></figure><hr><p>The proof is in the pudding. During our drive down to Florida and back, we made tons of contacts.  Despite the stealthy, near ridiculous size, we got good signal reports and were able to hear most of the activators during our drive.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/images/2025/04/map---POTA-contacts-during-FL-trip-with-Just-OK-Antenna.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1414" height="860" srcset="/images/size/w600/2025/04/map---POTA-contacts-during-FL-trip-with-Just-OK-Antenna.jpg 600w, /images/size/w1000/2025/04/map---POTA-contacts-during-FL-trip-with-Just-OK-Antenna.jpg 1000w, /images/2025/04/map---POTA-contacts-during-FL-trip-with-Just-OK-Antenna.jpg 1414w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Thank you to all of the activators for keeping us company on our drive and making it so fun!<br><br>As you can see on the map, the green dots show our trip from Alabama to Florida and back.  We were very impressed with the results. We were just hoping the antenna survived the trip and we could make a few contacts. Not only could we hear most of you very well, but we got great signal reports too!<br><br>When we play radio in the car, the non-driver is always the one in control of the radio – safety first. If you've ever considered getting HF in your car/truck, it can be a ton of fun!  Whether you want to make long trips more fun or be ready to park and play radio from anywhere.<br><br>If you have a standard 3/4"-24T antenna mount and have any of the problems we did, getting in and out of the garage or having to always take your antenna off, let us know. We're looking for a small group of beta testers.<br><br>73 Mike N4FFF &amp; Becky N4BKY</p>
