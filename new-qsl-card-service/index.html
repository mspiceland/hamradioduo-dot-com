If you've ever made a new radio contact and then completely forgot to mail out a QSL card, then this is for you. Our new service lets you send a QSL card right from your phone or computer, just after finishing your QSO. It's quick, fun, and no more forgotten cards cluttering your to-do list!</p><p>You can simply look up your contact, add a personal note, and send your QSL card all using your phone or computer. Just like that, you've got a QSL card en route!</p><h2 id="why-we-created-this">Why We Created This</h2><p>We made this for us first, but then we wanted to share it with everyone else. Confession time: we used to be pretty bad at remembering to send QSL cards. This service was our solution, and it turned out to be so useful, we decided to share it with everyone. Currently, it's only available for ham operators in the USA. We hope that if people use it and it grows, we can make it available internationally (and we have some very neat ideas too).</p><h3 id="watch-our-video-to-see-the-details">Watch Our Video to See the Details</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LdEx4SJMwOk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Want to give it a try? Visit the HamRadioDuo <a href="https://qslcards.hamradioduo.com">QSL cards page</a>.  After you set up your design, you can select contacts, type a custom message, and have it automatically printed and mailed for you.  No need to purchase cards in bulk, buy stamps / envelops, waste ink, or completely forget.  The biggest value is <strong>the time you'll save</strong> and the fun you'll have getting them back in return!</p><h2 id="stay-connected">Stay Connected</h2><p>Subscribe to our channels and be the first to know about our latest adventures and innovations:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZof7qI_B6GzfUY4sa-oWvA">Ham Radio Duo</a></li></ul><p>Curious for more?
