Pack your gear and bring along your morse skills because today we're diving into the magical world of Monte Sano State Park, for another fun POTA activation. Nestled in the beautiful landscapes, this park is a symphony of towering rock formations, lush hiking trails, and nature’s elegance. This time, we had our trusty sidekick, POTA dog Rose, joining the fun (and sniffing out all the best climbing spots, of course!). It's a place where serenity meets adventure—just what we love.</p><h2 id="qcx-mini-becky-uses-the-radio-she-built">QCX-mini: Becky Uses The Radio She Built!</h2><p>The star of this activation? Becky’s freshly built QCX-mini for 40m. The excitement was real! After a quick setup involving our EFHW antenna paired with a trusty mast and ground stake, we were ready to rock... or so we thought. Despite the weather spirits attempting to rain on our radio parade (well, almost), we bravely trudged on. Spoiler alert: the bands weren’t exactly cooperating at 40m, but like any true adventure, we found our groove on 20m and successfully completed the QRP activation!</p><h2 id="surprises-smiles-and-signals">Surprises, Smiles, and Signals</h2><p>This activation featured a special touch—from our radio friend NB0W, who sent us his video version of our exchange. Thank you, Scott! Your clip offered a delightful twist to our usual adventure sauce. We made 20 contacts in total, with our signals reaching as far as Michael S in Colorado, spanning a whopping 1449 miles. And yes, for those wondering, Becky was grinning ear-to-ear every time that little QCX mini beeped a successful connection.</p><p>Ready to dive into our little adventure?
