            <h1 id="cw-morse-code-checker-tool">CW Morse Code Checker Tool</h1><p>Of course we don't mean how is your literal fist, but how is your CW fist? Becky recently got a new Vibroplex Bug from the '60s. One of the first steps was to adjust everything and make sure that it works well. After watching some videos online, and one in particular from Adam AI4UH, we learned that there are CW fist checking apps for Windows that make fine business measuring the exact timing for adjusting your bug.</p><p>Unfortunately, we don't have access to Windows machines. Since we already have a couple of tools that use the vband adapter that lets you connect your key directly to your computer, we went down a rabbit hole and popped out the other side with a new tool!</p><h2 id="perfect-your-morse-code-using-the-cw-checker">Perfect Your Morse Code Using the CW Checker</h2><p>We actually believe the best way to send good code is primarily listening to good computer generated code and then trying to send the same thing by sound. We even record ourselves and listen to ourselves. Still, after realizing what the fist checker does, we realized it would be really handy to be able to visualize how close we were to computer generated Morse code.</p><p>So, what does this CW Checker do? If you love Morse code like we do, you’ll appreciate this tool that works right in your browser. It checks your Morse code sending with a VBand or Vail adapter. As Becky practices with her new bug, we've realized how important it is to get your dit sending speed and dit-to-dah ratio perfect. This tool is your digital coach, helping you master those codes.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4K_uYRs2d-w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h2 id="what-you-need-to-get-started">What You Need to Get Started</h2><p>Ready to jump in?
